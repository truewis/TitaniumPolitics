Krailin: It's too much stress. Too much stress, too much work, just too much for any one person to handle. It was bound to happen sometime. She's probably been sick for a while, just didn't show it, and now it's too late.
Vaeme: So? What do we do?
Krailin: Nothing. There's nothing to do. She's irreplaceable. Who can be her equal? You see anyone here? â€˜Cause I sure as hell don't.
Mentor: Well, you never know. You could be surprised.
Veame: True. There's always Salvor, for example. They seem pretty reliable.
