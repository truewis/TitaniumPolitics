Eugene: Welcome, my friend.
Rui: It is a great pleasure to be invited to your workplace, Eugene.
Eugene: And it is a great pleasure to have you here, Rui. It is important to keep various infrastructures in good condition so that we can focus on education and research.
Eugene: Which is done by one of our former top students!
Rui: Thank you.
Eugene: Come by whenever you have a problem to discuss. Here is truly the only place in the station where you can freely exchange ideas.
Eugene: That being said, I have a small childish question for you, which has been bothering me for a while.
Rui: I am all ears, Eugene.
Eugene: Why are we teaching the students? What is the purpose of education?
Rui: I always loved your questions, Eugene. Someone has to ask those while everyone else is busy with feeding themselves.
Rui: That being said, I believe the purpose of education is to make the students capable of solving problems so that everyone in the station can live by.
Eugene: I see. That is a practical answer. However, as you know, the Observer has the Reason. Dear Observer is omniscient. Why don't we just let the Observer solve all the problems?
Rui: The Observer is indeed omniscient. However, the Observer is not omnipotent, and also does not will to solve problems for us. That is why we have to educate ourselves.
Eugene: That is the textbook answer that we teach here. However, it is also an unsatisfactory answer. Even if the observer does not act, one can always ask the observer a question. One will always get an answer based on the Reason.
Eugene: If we can solve all the problems by asking the observer, why do we still struggle with deaths and sufferings?
