Rui: So, that will do it.
Woman: So...what happens to the people inside, dear engineers? I haven't seen my son! He might still be inside!
Salvor: The diligent members of the division are trying their best to save the people.
Woman: But didn't you say that you will extinguish the fire by depressurizing the section?
Rui: Um...I have no intent of glossing over this, madam. They will die.
Woman: There...there must be a better way. Please hear me, dear engineer. I worked as a firefighter in the safety division for my entire life.
Rui: I am glad you brought that point out. Have you ever been into a position where you have to make a decision?
Rui: The fire is spreading too fast. If it reaches one of the energy storage units, it will cause violent explosion. We only have a few minutes until then.
