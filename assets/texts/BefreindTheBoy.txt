Boy1: aAhw Shit! Roy, come and see who you've hit!
Roy: Who the fuck are you talking about?
Boy1: A tech bro, oh not a bro, a gal!
Roy: No way!
Rui: Uhm... so whose ball is this?
Roy: Dear engineer, that is my ball!
Rui: Oh, nice to see you again Roy. Were you playing the ball?
Roy: No, dear engineer, I didn't! The ball suddenly just moved out of my foot!
Rui: Sounds good. Where did you get the ball?
Roy: My father bought it for me!
Rui: Oh that is interesting. Who is your father?
Roy: I don't know. Haven't seen that guy for years.
Rui: Hmm...
