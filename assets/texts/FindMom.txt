BoyFindingMom: Hey there!
Rui: Do you know me?
BoyFindingMom: I saw you at the square. You were with my mom!
Rui: Oh, cool. Anything else?
BoyFindingMom: Can you give this to my mom? She left it when she went to work.
Rui: I don't even know who your mom is. I meet a lot of people at the square.
BoyFindingMom: She works in the mine. She'll see you if you wait there with the box!
Rui: I'm sorry, but I can't do that. First of all, I am far too busy to just stand in the mine entrance indefinitely. Second, people can be very hesitant to approach strangers. I don't want to make your mom uncomfortable.
BoyFindingMom: If you don't take this, I'll let my mom know that an engineer with the name Rui harassed me.
Rui: (Ick...) That's not true at all. I'm not harassing you. I'm just trying to explain why I can't help you.
BoyFindingMom: Doesn't matter. Why would my mom believe you over me?
Rui: Darn it. Give me the box. I'll try my best to give it to your mom.
Rui: One last word, young man. You better be more polite to strangers. Some people will not accept this kind of behavior.
BoyFindingMom: Thank you!
