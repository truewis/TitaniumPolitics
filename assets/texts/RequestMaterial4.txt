Alina: Something went wrong?
Rui: How did you know?
Alina: It's written all over your face. Honestly again, try to hide it better if you want to stay in the job.
Rui: Yes, ma'am.
Alina: So, what happened?
Rui: The industry division leader is not happy that I came directly to him with the request. He said you should have been the one to ask him.
Alina: I see. I'll talk to him. You can go now.
Rui: Thank you, ma'am. What should I do next?
Alina: Just wait for my call and don't ruin anything else.
Rui: Yes, ma'am.
