IndustryDivisionLeader: Ok. Your request is noted. I have one question though.
Rui: Yes, sir.
IndustryDivisionLeader: Why didn't Alina directly come to me and ask for this?
Rui: She's busy with other tasks. She asked me to do it.
IndustryDivisionLeader: You should really know it doesn't work that way. Representation is important. What would my division people think of the leader if a random technician can come by freely and ask for things?
Rui: Uhm... being an efficient leader?
IndustryDivisionLeader: You really have a lot to learn. That's it, I will not file this request. Go and tell Alina to come directly to me.
