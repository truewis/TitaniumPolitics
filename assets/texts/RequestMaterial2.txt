Alina: Good. It seems to me that we don't nearly have enough number of {COLOR=RED}components{ENDCOLOR} there. I think we need 200 more.
Rui: Where did you get that number from?
Alina: I just made it up.
Alina: Honestly Rui, your job is not to question me. I'm saying this for your own good; you won't last long with that attitude.
Alina: Your job now is to find the industry division leader and file the request for 200 more {COLOR=RED}components{ENDCOLOR}.
Rui: Got it.
