Alina: By the way, Rui, I finally found a job for you.
Rui: I'm listening, ma'am.
Alina: You are going to survey the inventory of our workplaces.
Alina: To remind you, there are nine workplaces in total. Two construction yards, three recycling facilities, two electrolysis stations, two water reservoirs.
Rui: That must take a while, but I can do that.
Alina: Exactly. I'll give you two days. Report to me back in our daily meetings.
