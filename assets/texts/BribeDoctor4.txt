Rui: Here is the requested tank.
DrPaik: Thank you so much. Your kind act will save hundreds of lives.
Rui: Will you keep Sylvia in the hospital now?
DrPaik: She already went home, perfectly healthy.
Rui: What...? You can't just suddenly cure someone of a terminal illness.
DrPaik: Yes, you can. You just need the right medicine.

DrPaik: Just a moment. Hi! How can I help you?
LOST: Explain what happened to our daughter. Right now!
DrPaik: I'm really sorry. We tried everything we could, but she didn't make it.
LOST: You're lying you fucking crook! I was told you finally got the pill delivered!
DrPaik: We thought so. But it turned out that the pill was not available anymore. We could not find a second dose in time.
LOST: What...? You must be fucking joking.

Guard: I'm sorry for your loss sir, but you can't do this.
LOST: My sweet angel... Papa is so sorry. Shouldn't have trusted these monsters...
Guard: Come with us.
DrPaik: Thank you.
DrPaik: Sorry for the havoc.
Rui: Tell me what I'm thinking is not true.
DrPaik: The right medicine to cure a disease can be exceedingly rare.
Rui: You are full of shit.
DrPaik: Hear me out. For months the infrastructure division could not repair one simple water tank in the hospital, one of the most critical facilities in the station.
DrPaik: Hundreds of people died here right in front of me because of that.
DrPaik: And all of a sudden, it is fixed magically, right after the wife of a senior member of the division got ill. What a coincidence!
Rui: I'm leaving.
DrPaik: You did a good deed after all. And you helped Sylvia too! I'm sorry for the father, but our decision saved more lives overall.
