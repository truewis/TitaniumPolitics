Rui: You don't look so great. Anything wrong?
Mentor: I'm fine. I'm just a little tired.
Rui: All of us are tired, but you look like you're about to collapse.
Mentor: Oh, Rui. Where should I begin? Well, here's the thing. My wife is sick.
Rui: You had a wife?
Mentor: Yes, I did. She's been sick for a while now, hospitalized in the upper deck welfare center.
Rui: Is that why you didn't speak of her?
Mentor: Yeah. And the doctor there told me that she's a lost cause. They're going to abandon her within days. I don't know what to do.
Rui: That's terrible. Can't we convince them to keep her?
Mentor: Convince them of what? That we found a cure for her?
Rui: No, but convince the doctor that we can do a favor for him in return. We are technicians, after all.
Mentor: Rui... I don't know. I don't know if I can do that.
Rui: I can do it for you. I'll go to the welfare center and talk to the doctor. What's her name?
Mentor: Sylvia. Her name is Sylvia... Thank you, Rui. But don't be too hard on the doctor. I don't want to ruin your reputation.
Rui: I'll be fine. I'll be back soon.
