Rui: What's up, young man?
Boy: Good evening, dear engineer.
Rui: It's late. Why aren't you going to bed?
Boy: Dear engineer, My mom told me that I cannot come back in until I learn how to respect the authorities.
Rui: Well, it seems you learned already.
Boy: And I apologize for not respecting you last time I saw you, dear engineer.
Rui: Quite frankly, I think boy of your age should learn how to play with friends way before then to respect the useless authorities, including me.
Rui: But don't tell this to anybody. Go back to home and tell mom that I accepted your apology.
Boy: But why would she believe that?
Rui: Ha! Now the table is flipped, isn't it? But I can't just run into your house. That will frighten your mom. Instead, I'll write you the proof. That is how the politics is done here.
Boy: Thank you, dear engineer.
