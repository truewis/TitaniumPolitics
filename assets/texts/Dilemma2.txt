Man: But you cannot represent human value with mere numbers!
DrHess: Whoever says that is just trying to distract you. In the triage process, some humans are more important in others. It always has been.
DrHess: And it is not all about power and class either. Without the manager the mine will fall apart.
Man: But we have done it well altogether before!
DrHess: What has happened a week ago when the manager was vacant convinces me otherwise. That sole event caused way more casualties than the all people trapped in the shaft combined.
DrHess: It is not just me who is convinced that saving the manager will potentially save many more people in the shaft, then the other way around.
Man: I hope your family will be in the same situation in the future, dear psychopath doctor. I hope they die brutally because their combined worth is less then someone else's fucking statue.
DrHess: Well, I don't think I will be able to make a rational decision for the humankind by then, but someone else will. That is how our station has survived for centuries. By not reling on temporary human attachments but on the scientific measurement of utility.
